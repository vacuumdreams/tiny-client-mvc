#tiny js mvc

this project was originally an interview test task


### tools

to run a dev build, you guys need to have the following tools installed globally:

- node.js & npm
- bower (npm install -g bower)
- karma (npm install -g karma-cli)
- gulp (npm install -g gulp)

after you have all these set up, just run:

- npm i

this will get all the project dependencies set up for you.

### tests

tests are just experimental for now, as I was playing around karma and jasmine.

tests can be run by the following command:

- npm test

### build

you should be able to make everything work just by running:

- gulp

the project hasn't got any backend server implementation, so you'll have to drag the index.html in to a browser to see what's going on.
